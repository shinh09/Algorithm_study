Problem Description

You are given a set of ropes, each with a different maximum weight capacity. The objective is to determine the maximum weight of an object that can be lifted using any subset of these ropes.

Each rope in a selected subset must evenly share the weight of the object. This means that if k ropes are used to lift an object of weight w, then each rope must endure w/k. However, no rope can endure more than its maximum capacity.

Example

Given ropes = [10, 20, 20], let's analyze why the maximum weight is 40:

•        The three ropes have maximum capacities of [10, 20, 20].

•        If we use only the rope with 10, the max weight we can lift is 10.

•        If we use one rope of 20, the max weight we can lift is 20.

•        If we use both ropes of 20, then they evenly split the total weight, meaning each can handle half the load.

•        Since each can lift 20, the total weight they can lift together is 20 + 20 = 40.

•        If we tried using all three ropes (10, 20, 20), the weight would be divided evenly among three ropes, limiting the total weight.

•        Optimal Choice: Using only the two 20 ropes achieves the maximum weight capacity of 40.

API

public int maxWeight(int[] ropes)

Input:

ropes: An integer array representing the maximum weight each rope can endure.

Output:

An integer representing the maximum weight that can be lifted using a subset of ropes.

Constraints:

1 ≤ ropes.length ≤ 100, 1 ≤ ropes[i] ≤ 1000



Main method for Test

public class Test {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Itm itm = new Itm(); // Create an instance of the Itm class



        // Define an integer array containing the maximum weight each rope can endure

        int[] ropes = {10, 20, 20};



        // Compute the maximum weight that can be lifted

        int result = itm.maxWeight(ropes);



        // Print the result, expected output is 40

        System.out.println("Maximum weight that can be lifted: " + result);

    }
